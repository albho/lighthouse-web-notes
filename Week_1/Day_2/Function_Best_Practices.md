### Function Rules
1. Give your functions precise verb/action based names.
2. Use camelCasedNames.
3. Properly indent the function code.
4. Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect.
5. Data needed by Functions should be passed in as parameters/arguments (i.e. local scope).

### Naming Conventions
- use clear, descriptive, concise names.
- name functions beginning with *action* words.
- be consistent with naming conventions.
- if joining an existing project, observe and adapt any existing conventions.
